Jasmine Exercises: Loan Calculator + Tip Pool
We were given two pages:
**Calculator**
For the calculator I needed to code the formula and make sure it worked using Jasmine tests.
**Tip Pool**
1- Complete JASMINE Test inside server.test.js
2- Create a `helpers.test.js` file and test each function in `helpers.js`
- Create a `payments.test.js` file and test each function in `payments.js`
- When finished you should have three .test.js files one for each .js file
3-Test your own code
- Review the functionality of `appendTd(tr, value)`
- Create a `appendDeleteBtn(tr)`, it will be similar to `append(tr, value)`. This function will create a ‘td’ with the value ‘X’, when clicked it will delete the table row it belongs to
- Write the functionality for appending a ‘td’ to a ‘tr’ with the value ‘X’
- Set an click event listener on the ‘td’ that will remove the parent ‘tr’ from the dom. You will have to find a way to access the parent row of the ‘td’ from the click event
- Write tests for `appendDeleteBtn(tr)`
